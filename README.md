# My USACO Boilerplates

## java
Currently I have 1 working Boilerplate that I use in competition. That is my java boilerplate.

 * #### notes:
 * Run a java file by first compiling the file with:  

    *javac boilerplate.java*

* Then running the file with:

    *java boilerplate*

Do this every time the file is changed

## python
I seldom use Python to solve USACO training and contest problems. I have yet to publish my boilerplate for this.
